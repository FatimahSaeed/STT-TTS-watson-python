# STT-TTS-watson-python
First task of week 5 for Smart Methods https://s-m.com.sa/

Speech to text and text to speech projects using IBM Watson services with Python language. 

First of all, I registered on IBM cloud and added Speech to text and text to speech services.

Then, wrote STT file that contain speech to text code. This code convert audio from the microphone into text through recognize speech using IBM Speech to Text and save the output as txt file in my_result.txt.

After that, wrote TTS file which contain text to speech code. This code convert text into speech through synthesize text using IBM Text to Speech and save the output as mp3 file in speech.mp3.

Finally, Tested the code by Python Shell and you can take look on the result from output files.

Note: this project need downloading requirments that compatiable with your device.
